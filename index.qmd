Hey there, welcome to my ePortfolio! 

I am a graduate student in the Master of Geomatics for Environmental Management (MGEM) program at UBC, currently working on a project that leverages multispectral imaging for vegetation species identification. My work focuses on applying remote sensing technologies to enhance ecological research and environmental decision-making.

Outside of academics, I enjoy playing tennis and volleyball. Whether on the court or in the field, I appreciate the balance of technique, observation, and adaptabilityâ€”qualities that also come into play in geomatics. This portfolio showcases my projects, skills, and experiences in the field. I'd love for you to explore my work and connect!
